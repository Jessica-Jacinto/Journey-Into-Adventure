Instructions:
With all files in one folder, open and run final_project_main.py,
which will call all the separate functions in order. Follow the
commands on screen to move throughout the game and complete various
challenges, the keys wsad are used to move, and y, n, and the
space bar are used for other interactions.

Project description:
This project is a video game designed to be challenging and entertaining.
Each level requires different kinds of problem solving, and the game
is intended to be encouraging and accessible to all players, although
younger children and teens might find some levels challenging. The
objective is to be a fun pastime for users. 

Architecture:
The game is composed of a series of functions, one for each level,
and classes. There is a person class that creates the image of the
person and allows them to move. There are subclasses for various types
of people you see in the game, including npc’s and the main character.
There is also a sword_shard class, which simply allows you to draw and
undraw a polygon called sword shard, which you encounter multiple times.
There is an old man class and a cow class for interface purposes to make
the game more interesting and fun. 
A major challenge:
One major challenge was in integrating the various elements of the game.
We used github and had difficulty downloading other people’s files and
keeping up with other people’s updated versions of their codes, especially
as the programs became more dependent on each other for full functionality.
The solution to this proved to be clear commenting of code so we could easily
understand each other’s code, communication, and looking at code together so
that we all remained on the same page at each step.
