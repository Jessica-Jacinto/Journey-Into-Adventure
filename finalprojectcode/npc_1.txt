AHA! So you are the brave adventurer I have heard so much about!
I'll help you get through this dungeon, but first, you must help me... 
Press y to help this farmer
Press n if you don't care about agriculture workers

I am a farmer, and my farmland is owned by a local lord.
He demands I pay rent by the square yard.
My plot is bounded on the left by the line
x equals 0, at the top by the function y equals
6 minus x squared,
and at the bottom by the function y equals x.
If he charges three pence per square yard, how
much do I owe my landlord?
y: I figured it out!
n: Uhh... what?
*
Challenging, right? That's why I need your help!
I figure a brave adventurer such as yourself must
have picked up some calculus experience along the
way. I can tell you that I've figured out that the
top and bottom functions meet at the point (2, 2),
So we know the bounds of integration at least!
y: Ok, thanks for the hint

*
No, that doesn't look right at all, perhaps you need
to hear it again?
Press y to continue
*
Wow! I think you've solved it! How can I ever repay
you? Oh, right!
Press Space to continue

I found this while I was hanging out down here! I'm
not sure what it is, but maybe it can help?
Press y to accept the item

Here's the door! Good luck with your quest!
