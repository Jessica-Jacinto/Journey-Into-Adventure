Why hello there adventurer!
I hope this journey is treating you well
Are you ready to play a game?
Y: to play
*
This is a classic game.
I hide the pearl and switch the cups around
then you must find it.
To win you must understand that
not everything is as it seems
Are you ready?
y: I can do this
*
You must pay attention
to what matters
*
Now click where you
think the pearl is
*
You've got it!
You have won a piece of the sword!
*
That is not correct.
You aren't seeing what needs to be seen.
Nor doing what needs to be done.

Before I let you go on
I want you to really look at me.
Do I look honest to you?
Do I look as if I won't cheat you?
The answer is in front of your very eyes
Are you ready to begin again?

Y: Yes
